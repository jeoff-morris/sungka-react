# Sungka

Sungka is an old Filipino game played on a block or game board. For further information on game play please check out this Wikipedia [Southeast Asian mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asian_mancala).

My intention is to create a modern, online game where people may meet up to have fun, whilst creating a new generation of Sungka players!
